## 2025-12-18 - Tab Navigation: Simplicity Over Workflow Guidance

**Learning:** User explicitly rejected step numbers and progress indicators on the main workflow tabs, requesting to "keep the tabs simple." This app's design philosophy favors clean, minimal navigation over visual workflow guidance - despite having a clear 4-step workflow (Upload → Process → Edit → Visualize).

**Action:** For this design system, avoid adding step indicators, progress dots, or numbered badges to navigation. Trust users to understand workflow sequence from tab labels alone. Reserve visual complexity for content areas, not navigation chrome.
