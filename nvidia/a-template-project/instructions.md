STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- Use numbered steps (# Step 1, # Step 2, etc.)
- Add more steps if needed
- Each step should have ONE clear objective
- Include verification steps after installations
- Use consistent formatting for commands and outputs

# Step 1. {First major step - usually verification/prerequisites/environment setup}

{Brief description of what this step accomplishes and why it's important.}

```bash
{command-to-run}
{another-command}
```

{Explanation of what the commands do and what output to expect.}

Expected output should show {description of successful output}.

# Step 2. {Installation/configuration step}

{What you're installing/configuring and why.}

```bash
{installation-command}
```

{Additional context about the installation - versions, dependencies, etc.}

# Step 3. {Main running step}

{Description of how to start/launch the main application.}

```bash
{launch-command}
```

{Explanation of what happens when you run this command.}

# Step 4. {Verification/testing step}

{How to verify everything is working correctly.}

```bash
{test-command}
```

Expected output should show {what indicates success}.

{Instructions for accessing the application - e.g., "Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<SPARK_IP>:8080` where `<SPARK_IP>` is your device's IP address."}

# Step 5. Cleanup

{When and why someone might need this step.}

> [!WARNING]
> This will {warning about what gets deleted/changed}.

```bash
{cleanup-commands}
```

{Explanation of what each command does.}

# Step 6. {Optional - Next steps/advanced usage}

{How to extend or build upon what they've accomplished.}

{Suggestions for further learning or customization:}

1. {Advanced feature or customization}
2. {Deployment to cloud}
3. {Integration with other tools}
4. {Performance optimization tips}
5. {How to monitor usage with `nvidia-smi` or other tools}

{Final success criteria if they follow these next steps/advanced usage - e.g., "The application should complete within 30-60 seconds depending on your hardware configuration."}
